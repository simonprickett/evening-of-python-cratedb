# An Evening of Python Coding: CrateDB

This repository contains accompanying resources for my talk about CrateDB at the Austin, DC and Northern Virginia Python groups "An Evening of Python Coding" event on January 22nd 2025.  You can [watch the video of my presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWvEUoHUkE4).

## Slides

The slides are included [here](./evening_of_python_cratedb_slides.pdf) in PDF format.

## Get a Free CrateDB Cluster in the Cloud

To try these exercises out for yourself, you'll need a CrateDB cluster.  The easiest way to get one is by signing up for a free cloud account at [console.cratedb.cloud](https://console.cratedb.cloud/) - no credit card or payment details required. 

## Jupyter Notebooks

Here are the Jupyter notebooks used in the session:

* [Multi-Model Data](https://github.com/crate/academy-fundamentals-course/tree/main/notebooks/multi_model_data).
* [Search](https://github.com/crate/academy-fundamentals-course/tree/main/notebooks/search).

These notebooks connect to CrateDB using the [SQLAlchemy dialect for CrateDB](https://github.com/crate/sqlalchemy-cratedb).

## Wind Farms Example Project

The code for the wind farms example Flask project can be found [here](https://github.com/crate/devrel-offshore-wind-farms-demo/).  This repository also contains a C# implementation.

This project uses the [crate-python](https://github.com/crate/crate-python) driver to talk to CrateDB.

## MicroPython Examples

Here's the [code for the MicroPython part of the demo](https://github.com/simonprickett/cratedb-micropython-examples).  These examples use the [CrateDB driver for MicroPython](https://github.com/crate/micropython-cratedb/).

## Datasets

Here are the datasets used in the session:

* [City of Chicago open data](https://github.com/crate/cratedb-datasets/tree/main/academy/chicago-data).
* [UK Offshore Wind Farm data](https://github.com/crate/cratedb-datasets/tree/main/devrel/uk-offshore-wind-farm-data).
